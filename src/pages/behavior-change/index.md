95% of our decisions happen without conscious awareness â€“ split-second, impulsive and easily influenced.

*Thinking Inside a Box* puts scientific understanding of these influences into the hands of designer and decision makers. It's an idea-generation tool; use it to change the behaviour of your customers, users, audience, friends, parents or children.
