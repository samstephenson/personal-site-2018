I'm Sam, a designer from the UK.

Currently, I'm researching the state of education in developing countries and designing new education programs, with Applied Cognitive Science. In the past few months, I've worked on projects in Zambia, Ethiopia and Laos.

Before that, I was based in San Francisco, interning at NewDealDesign﻿ and co-conspiring at the Red Victorian.

I studied Graphic Design at Falmouth University in UK.

If not at work – I'm hopefully somewhere on water or in the mountains. Kayaking, surfing, climbing, or hiking.
